 * installer/start entry points must acquire (or refuse) the same slot so a
 * competing mutation cannot slip between the checks.
 *
 * Two orthogonal conditions gate a mutating operation:
 *  1. `maintenanceHeld` — another operation currently owns the slot.
 *  2. `recoveryBlocked` — a persistent `blocked` import journal (or an
 *     unreadable one) means the destination trees are unresolved; no start
 *     or write may proceed until recovery reconciles them.
