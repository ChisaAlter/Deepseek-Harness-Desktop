# GUI polish (the three page/header macros below) is skipped in silent mode
# (/S). The single exception is customInit: a registry-hygiene block that also
# runs during silent installs and upgrades — by design, because the damage it
# guards against happens silently. It performs no UI, no exec, no sections;
# it only deletes install records that are already dead (non-absolute paths
# can never resolve) and repairs a poisoned $INSTDIR.

# Inserted where assistedInstaller.nsh declares pages, i.e. before the
# license/directory/instfiles/finish pages — the only place where MUI page
# defines for the finish page can still take effect.

# Inserted by assistedInstaller.nsh inside the BUILD_UNINSTALLER page list *in

# re-insert that page itself. MUI2's un-welcome page reuses the installer
# welcome-page settings (MUI_WELCOMEPAGE_TITLE_3LINES included) but MUI_UNSETs
# them after every page insertion, so the define from customWelcomePage never
# reaches the uninstaller — without this the localized un-welcome title's
# third line ("…Uninstall") is clipped. Page declaration only: MUI pages are
# never shown in silent mode, so /S uninstall and overwrite upgrades are
# untouched.

# --- Corrupted install-record hygiene (incident 2026-09-12) ----------------
#
# A stale record hijacks the upgrade path twice over: initMultiUser copies
# InstallLocation into $INSTDIR, and the old-uninstaller fallback derives the
# target dir from the quoted UninstallString. Both reads happen in/after
# initMultiUser; customInit runs immediately after it, still inside .onInit,
# before any page or section work.
#
# A record counts as live only when it is an absolute Win32 path AND still
# resolves on disk (InstallLocation → ${APP_EXECUTABLE_FILENAME} present;
# UninstallString → quoted uninstaller present). Anything else — drive-relative
# mangling like "C:AiDeepseek…" from an unquoted bash /D=, or a well-formed
# path whose directory was wiped — is deleted so stock upgrade logic can never
# see it, and $INSTDIR is recomputed: /D > live InstallLocation > live
# uninstaller dir > per-user default.
#
# GetInQuotes / GetFileParent are Functions from installUtil.nsh — included
# textually after .onInit, so their !macro wrappers are unavailable here, but
# Call targets resolve at compile time.
#
# _DSHD_IS_ABS src dst → dst="1" when src is an absolute Win32 path:
# X:\…, "X:\…", \\… or "\\…" (quote case covered by checking both offsets).
