# Feature: Plugin Session Navigation

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **id** | `plugin-session-navigation` |
| **status** | `active` |
| **last verified** | 2026-09-18 — Host-authoritative blank reuse passed 25 boundary tests, 272 workspace tests, and both real-browser New Session/first-send/reload flows; old logs stayed unchanged. 2026-09-17 — alpha.1 post-merge drift remediation: `conversation.hero.workspace` now gated by `hero` at construction (no workspace-picker slot fire for presentation-owned sessions); skeleton/input-bar specs assert the current `添加文件或调用指令` launcher; vendor GUI suite green. 2026-09-09 — managed-session header/titlebar integration passed 160 focused client tests, the full client TypeScript check, and the official build. Live Electron verified Bot and room sessions retain their real title and shared composer while preset, trajectory, Session log, branch and Commit controls are absent; root panel/window controls remain, and an ordinary New Session still shows Session log, branch and Commit. Conversation 35/35 and dshbot browser 49/49 passed. A blank plugin Session with an elected composer-overlay body removes the ordinary blank canvas from flex layout; live Electron verified the new room body uses the full 846px conversation height with zero document overflow. Real dshbot full-shell acceptance verifies fixed first-prompt IDs, blank-session non-reuse, docked input, list/search isolation and Host restart history. Existing preview Bot/room sessions also verified in isolated Electron. |

## User paths

1. Plugin-owned persistent sessions remain addressable through the same Session Controller and keep their real title in the conversation surface.
2. Ordinary workspace lists/search and blank reuse exclude owned rows; an ordinary New Session keeps the full session chrome.

## Invariants

- Optional log-only presentation metadata records owner and title; it does not grant execution permissions, change session identity, rewrite old logs or fake a turn. Null metadata releases ownership.
- The conversation surface keeps its normal docked composer before the first message and displays the owner title.
- Managed composer extension: optional presentation `composer: 'managed'` selects the shared editor without independent model, permission shortcut, plan, preset and developer-statistics chrome. It keeps the owner title while suppressing lineage/actions/utilities, multi-view tabs, Session-log download and Git titlebar actions; stale stored view selection falls back to the default conversation view. Root panel and window controls stay available. Its `conversation.input.managed` slot lets the owner open its configuration. This is presentation only, never an authorization bypass.
- The Session model-selection command accepts `saveAsDefault: false` for explicit plugin-local selections; ordinary callers retain the existing default-saving behavior. Managed sessions also suppress implicit default saving from other ordinary session-model entry points, such as the command menu. This is mutation scope, not authorization; selecting a session-local model is not denied by presentation.
- New Session reuse is confirmed by the read-only Host `session.blankReuse({ sessionId })` result through client `ISessions.canReuseBlank(sessionId, signal?)`. `blank` still means that no turn has started: any existing `session/title` pin makes the Session ineligible for New Session reuse, while the old pin remains unchanged when the user explicitly opens that Session. Any current or historical non-null plugin presentation, historical `system/message`, `user/message`, `assistant/message`, `tool/result`, `turn/start`, seeded/forked/inherited identity, or subagent identity also makes the Session ineligible. Missing Sessions return `reusable: false`; other read failures and cancellation remain errors. Ordinary model, permission, and plan setup remains reusable, with no Agent activation, cache schema/version change, or old-log rewrite.
- Workspace and no-directory New Session navigation prefilters summaries, awaits Host confirmation, rechecks current membership and archive state, and coalesces inspection plus creation per target. Reuse preserves existing titles, data, and layout; an ineligible, missing, or changed candidate is skipped for creation, while a real read error or cancellation propagates and does not create.
- dshbot ships built-in via `vendor/dshbot` + the desktop overlay (see the dshbot card); overall workflow completeness is tracked there.

- Historical non-empty `agent/inbox/spliced` input, `goal/change`, or `schedule/change` also excludes reuse: these events can persist pending work before the first turn. Later cancellation or goal clearing does not turn that identity into a new draft; empty inbox operations and ordinary configuration remain eligible.

## Allowed touch

- vendored api/session-controller types, commands, list projection and client summaries; client/ui-workspace navigation/tree; ui-conversation root rendering; related focused tests, documentation and built artifacts; independent dshbot integration. Preserve unrelated changes and all existing user session data.

## Gates

- projection/command tests, workspace list and draft reuse tests, conversation render tests, official build, actual dshbot full-shell first-send/isolation/reload acceptance and an isolated Electron preview. No branches, publication or live profile overwrite.
