/**
 * Main-thread client of the review-diff highlight Worker (`./highlight.worker.ts`,
 * embedded by tsdown and run from a Blob URL). One Worker per page serves every
 * mounted diff concurrently — jobs carry a `run` id so replies route to their
 * dispatch and a `drop` message lets the worker skip queued work a disposed
 * effect no longer needs. Worker startup is lazy and memoized: a page that
 * never renders a diff never fetches the worker chunk.
 *
 * Availability is deliberately tentative: `Worker` missing, a blocked Blob
 * URL, a chunk that fails to load, or a worker error all degrade to `undefined`
 * / the `failed` callback, and the caller falls back to inline sliced
 * highlighting with plain text readable throughout — highlighting is an
 * enhancement, never a render dependency.
