/**
 * Review-diff highlight Worker entry — bundled self-contained by tsdown (see
 * the `?raw` interception in `tsdown.config.ts`) and run from a Blob URL, so
 * the whole shiki engine plus its per-rule scanner builds execute off the
 * main thread. The scanner build for a rule set is a single indivisible
 * `tokenizeLine2` descent (~50-200 ms measured) that no main-thread slicing
 * can interrupt; this file is the boundary the review-diff D5 budget needs.
 *
 * Protocol (one shared Worker per page, FIFO, run-scoped so concurrent panels
 * never invalidate each other):
 * - `{op:'job', run, job, code, lang}` — tokenize one hunk side in one call
 *   (no per-task budget off the main thread) and reply `done` with per-line
 *   spans plus the worker-side milliseconds, or `missing` when the resolved
 *   grammar is not registered in this realm.
 * - `{op:'drop', run}` — the owning effect disposed; queued jobs of that run
 *   are skipped at dequeue so a closed diff stops costing worker time.
 * - `{op:'langs', registrations}` — register grammar data the main thread
 *   fetched from the lazy table, after which the reposted job tokenizes.
 *
 * The engine module this imports must stay free of dynamic imports: a
 * self-contained bundle inlines every `import()` it can see, which would pull
 * all forty-plus lazy grammars into the Worker text.
