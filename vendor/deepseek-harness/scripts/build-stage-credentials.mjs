/**
 * Per-stage build credentials for the official build.
 *
 * `build:official` used to be all-or-nothing: the root prestart gate compared
 * the build record's commit hash with the checkout's HEAD and, on any
 * difference, re-ran native, host, client and web from scratch. A commit that
 * touched only `src/main/**` or docs therefore paid a complete client rebuild.
 *
 * This module gives each stage its own credential. A stage is reused only when
 * all four of its recorded facts still hold:
 *
 * - **inputs** — every file the stage reads, recorded as a cheap size/mtime/
 *   ctime manifest *and* as a content digest. A same-size/same-mtime edit moves
 *   ctime (which no ordinary writer can suppress), so the manifest moves, the
 *   content digest is recomputed and the change is caught. New untracked files,
 *   deletions and renames change the path list, which the manifest covers. No
 *   step consults Git, so a dirty or untracked working tree is handled by the
 *   same rule as a committed one;
 * - **outputs** — every artifact the stage writes, recorded the same way, so a
 *   tampered, truncated or partially deleted tree fails verification instead of
 *   being reused, while a rebuild that produces identical bytes still verifies;
 * - **environment** — the public values the stage's artifacts actually embed,
 *   so a commit/version bump rebuilds the browser bundles without redoing the
 *   native or host work, and never by faking the recorded value;
 * - **formatVersion** — an unrecognized schema is ignored and the stage re-runs
 *   rather than being trusted.
 *
 * Every failure mode reports "must rebuild": a missing, unreadable or
 * unparsable credential, a missing stage entry, an input mismatch, an output
 * mismatch and an environment mismatch. A credential can only ever skip work;
 * it can never make a stage succeed that would otherwise fail.
 *
 * Cost: the steady-state check walks the stage roots and stats each file, which
 * is ~1 s for the reference checkout's 18k files. One walk/stat cache is shared
 * by all four stage checks in a run (they overlap heavily) and is never
 * persisted. Content digests (about 160 MB across the four stages) are only
 * recomputed for a stage whose manifest moved, read with bounded parallelism.
